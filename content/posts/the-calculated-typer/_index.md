### Abstract

This article shows how type-checking functions can be calculated from
specifications of their behaviour using equational reasoning techniques.  In
addition, we show how the resulting calculations can be simplified by taking an
algebraic approach using a fold operator and its associated fusion property,
and further improved by taking a constraint-based approach to solving fusion
preconditions. We illustrate our approach with three examples of increasing
complexity, starting with a simple expression language, then adding support for
exceptions, and finally considering a version of the lambda calculus.
