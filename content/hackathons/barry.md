Imagine if you could phone a Dalek and tell him what to do...

Making that dream a reality was mine and Peter's *ManMetHacks 2.0* hack: Barry
the Dalek! In an attempt to grab the *Twilio* prize at the hackathon, we made an
SMS interface to this toy Dalek.

Barry has a phone number, and you can text him commands. `gf`, for example, will
instruct him to go forwards. `gb` will go backward, and `tl` and `tr` will turn
around. `s something` will have him speak the words "something" out of a super
janky speaker and amp setup. It kind of sounds like a real Dalek!

Barry started out as a generic toy Dalek, but we hacked him apart, pulled out
his internals, and replaced them with a Pi. Needless to say, we ran into some
issues here, and you can read much more about these on
[our Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/barry-the-dalek) if you're
interested.
