*Tomb of Avarris* was a project I made at *HackTheMidlands 7.0* with Oli,
Jacob, and Caleb. We wanted to make a fun party game (along the lines of
*Jackbox*) and really focus on interesting mechanics as well as polish
(something I generally don't put any thought into at all).

You start by picking a character, each of which has a different set of bonuses
or features. The idea of the game, then, is that the group is presented with a
series of challenges (such as *"There's a troll booth! How do you get past?"*
or *"This door appears to be locked..."*). You've got to come up with a creative
solution based on your character and any items you've picked up or found along
the way.

Overall, I'm really pleased with the level of polish we achieved with this one.
It feels like something you could actually play, like as a real game, which is
honestly not something I bother with very often.

Given this, it's ironic that during our demo, the computer we were running the
game on completely crashed and died, and as a result, we couldn't actually show
anybody anything... Oh well.
