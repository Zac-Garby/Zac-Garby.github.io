A musical instrument we made at *OxfordHack 2022*!

Made by myself, George, and Oli, this is a whiteboard-based musical instrument,
using *OpenCV* in *Python*. We had three pens, and each colour corresponds to a
different octave and instrument.

You can draw lines on the board, and these correspond to notes, which are played
back live while you draw. And, if you draw a wavy line, the sound is wavy! It's
actually pretty fun. Hard to make anything that sounds good, but it *is*
possible (see Among Us Drip, below: the first official Music Board single).

This was one of those projects which was completely determined by the random
objects we decided to bring with us on the day. I had this big yellow clamp in
my bag, and a webcam; and, at University at the time, I was working on a similar
computer vision project for my Music & Mixed Reality module. In fact, I was able
to steal a lot of the code from this (mostly the webcam streaming and perspective
correction).

The project was great fun, and we won, I think quite fittingly, the
*"What The Hack?!"* prize! Have a look at
[the Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/music-board-ym59oz) for a
few more photos and a more detailed writeup.
